# macOS-Tahoe-in-Web
A web-based experimental recreation of the macOS "Tahoe" UI, built entirely with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project explores how far the native macOS look and feel can be brought to the browser without any frameworks or libraries. Designed for learning, inspiration, and fun.
