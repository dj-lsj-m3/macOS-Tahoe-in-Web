## 🚀 Overview

**macOS Tahoe in Web** is a front-end experiment aimed at mimicking the iconic aesthetics and user experience of macOS — all inside a web browser. This project is fully handcrafted without using any UI libraries or modern JS frameworks. Just raw code, for maximum control and learning.

Whether you're into UI/UX design, web development, or just enjoy Apple-style interfaces, this project offers a clean sandbox to explore how modern desktop-style UIs can be rendered in the browser.
